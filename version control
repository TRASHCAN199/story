version control:
let assume that we want to creat a new file and write a few lines in it. And now we decide to put in under version control using git 
and we call the save point as no.1. later on as we progress we write few more lines of code and we decide to make an other save point 
called sace point no.2 . further down the line we acdentally mess up the code to the point where we would start from scratch rather than 
continue our code, so we simply want to role back to the last save point. we can do that using git. we can compare the current code file 
with the previous versions that we have made or alternatively we can roll back to previous versions. 

commands:
git init : this command initiallizes an empty git reposotory inside the working directory/ current directory

ls -a : shows all files incuding hidden files

in order to start tracking the chages in the files, then we need to add the files to what is called a staging area. it is basically an 
intermediate place where we can pick and choose which files inside the working directory we want to commite.

git status : shows which files are in staging area (shown in green) and which files are not in staging area (shown in red)

git add <filename> : this command adds the file <filename> to staging area.

git commit -m "<message>" : commits all the files in the staging area. the commit messge should we writtern in present tense for eg:
                            "complete chapter 1"

git log : we can see the commits we have made using this command.
